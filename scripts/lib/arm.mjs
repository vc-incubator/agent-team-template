// Two lists that have never met: what workflows/*.yml declares, and what the routines API says
// actually exists. Comparing them is the whole point of this file.
//
// This repo carries NINE workflow files declaring a schedule, against one real routine. Every board
// reading those files reported nine jobs running, each with a next-run time, because a file that
// says `schedule:` looks exactly like a job that runs. Nobody lied; nothing checked.
//
// (It was written as "ten" here for a while, which is its own small version of the same disease.
// A file that says a number nobody counted is the thing this module exists to catch.)
//
// A job is in one of FOUR states, and the two middle ones are the bugs:
//
//   armed       the file says run it, and a routine exists
//   declared    the file says run it, and NOTHING rings          - a wish
//   unapproved  a routine RINGS, and the file says it is off     - spend nobody approved
//   off         deliberately not armed, and nothing rings
//
// `unapproved` was missing for a while, and its absence was the same bug pointing the other way:
// a routine firing every morning, matched to a file saying `armed: false`, appeared in no list at
// all. The read-back said "0 jobs armed, spending 0 runs a week" while runs were being spent
// daily. A board that can only see over-claiming is half a check.
//
// `armed:` defaults to false. A workflow that has never been through /arm is off, not running,
// which is the safe direction and means nothing arms itself by existing.
