// A verdict is the owner saying what they did with a piece the team made. It is the only file in
// this repo written BY the owner ABOUT the team, and the whole improvement stage is built on it:
// acceptance rate is shipped / (shipped + edited + rejected), and every rule the team learns
// starts life in one of these files.
//
// It was also the only artifact in the repo with no checker. runs/ has validate:runs, ledger.yml
// has check:ledger, proposals.yml has check:proposals, workflows/ has check:arming. A verdict
// naming a run that never happened, an artifact that was never written, and a verdict value that
// is not one of the three passed every one of them - and the lesson taught the consequence as if
// it were the design: "anything else cannot be counted, so the review silently drops it."
//
// Silently dropping a verdict does not lower the acceptance rate. It removes the piece from both
// halves of the fraction, so a week where the owner rejected everything can report a clean 100%.
