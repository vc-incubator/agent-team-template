   to. It survives a heartbeat today only because a heartbeat has no `run_id` and so filters out -
   an accident of what heartbeats currently hold, not a guard, and precisely how the first one hid.

   This is a source-shape guard rather than a behavioural one, and that is worth saying out loud:
   check-verdicts reads verdicts from the repo root but runs/ from the working directory, so it
   cannot be pointed at a temp repo - with no verdicts in the real repo it exits before the sweep
   is ever reached. The walk itself IS covered behaviourally, by the temp-directory test above.
